# Description

[Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io) input plugin able to access [Docker Container Inspect](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.41/#operation/ContainerInspect)

# Requirements

- Docker
- Docker image `fluent-beats/fluent-bit-plugin-dev`

# Build
```bash
./build.sh
```

# Test
```bash
./test.sh
 ```

# Design

## Required volumes

This plugin requires some volumes to collect metrics from containers running in the `host node`.

It maps the folder `/var/lib/docker/containers` so it can simply know all containers' ids running in the underline host without any request/response to Docker Engine API.

It also maps the **host unix socket** `/var/run/docker.sock`, so it can send requests to the Docker Engine API to fetch data for containers retrieved previously from mounted `/var/lib/docker/containers`.

> This plugin WILL NOT WORK without both volumes properly mounted on `Fluentbit` container

## Collecting data
The plugin will access the Docker Engine endpoint `/containers/{id}/json`.

It will use the following parameters:
 * size=true (return information about container size)

Each response will include important information like:

 - Container health / state
 - Container image
 - Container labels
 - Container volumes and ports

## Configurations

This input plugin can be configured using the following parameters:

 Unix_Path              | Define target Unix socket path.                                               | /var/run/docker.sock
 Containers_Path        | Define the folder that contains containers' ids. | /var/lib/docker/containers
 Buffer_Size            | The size of the buffer used to read data (in bytes or [unit sized](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/administration/configuring-fluent-bit/unit-sizes))                                                                                           | 12288

 Key                    | When a message is unstructured (no parser applied), it's appended as a string under the key name message.                                                                                               | message
